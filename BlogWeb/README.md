# Siva Blog – Modern & Responsive Personal Blog

Welcome to **Siva Blog**, a modern, responsive personal blog website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates a clean, accessible, and interactive blog experience with dynamic content loading, theme switching, and smooth animations.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle:** Easily switch between light and dark modes.
- **Dynamic Blog Posts:** Blog content is loaded dynamically from [`blog-data.js`](blog-data.js).
- **Interactive Modal:** Click on any blog post to view full content in a modal window.
- **Smooth Animations:** Scroll and fade-in effects for engaging user experience.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, focus management, and semantic HTML.
- **Social Links:** Footer with links to Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn.

## Project Structure

blog-data.js      # Blog post data (JSON format)
counter.js        # Vite starter counter (demo)
index.html        # Main HTML file
main.js           # Vite starter main (demo)
README.md         # Project documentation
script.js         # Main JavaScript for blog functionality
style.css         # Main stylesheet

## How It Works

- Blog posts are defined in [`blog-data.js`](blog-data.js) as an array of objects.
- The main UI and modal logic are handled in [`script.js`](script.js).
- Styling and responsive layout are provided by [`style.css`](style.css).
- The website is fully static and requires no backend.
