## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    bash
    git clone <https://github.com/your-username/weather-dashboard.git>
    cd weather-dashboard

2. **Get an API Key:**
    - Go to OpenWeatherMap and create a free account.
    - Navigate to the 'API keys' tab and get your unique API key.

3. **Add the API Key to the project:**
    - Open the `script.js` file.
    - Find the following line:
    javascript
      const apiKey = 'your api'; // Api key for OpenWeatherMap

    - Replace `'API'` with your own API key.

4. **Run the application:**
    - Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application is initialized when the DOM is fully loaded.

1. **Initialization (`init`):** The script first checks `localStorage` for a `lastSearchedCity`. If found, it fetches the weather for that city. Otherwise, it attempts to use the browser's Geolocation API to get the user's current position and fetch the weather for that location.

2. **Data Fetching (`getWeatherData`):** When a city is searched or determined via geolocation, the app makes two concurrent API calls to OpenWeatherMap using `Promise.all`:
    - One for the current weather.
    - One for the 5-day forecast.

3. **UI Update (`updateUI`):** Upon receiving the data, the UI is dynamically updated. This includes:
    - Populating the current weather details (temperature, condition, etc.).
    - Generating and displaying cards for the 5-day forecast.
    - Changing the body's background class based on the main weather condition (e.g., 'Clear', 'Clouds', 'Rain').

4. **Event Handling:** An event listener on the search form captures user input, prevents the default form submission, and triggers the `getWeatherData` function.
